## Question 1

I. This question involves reasoning about strings made up of uppercase letters. You will implement two related methods that appear in the same class (not shown). The first method takes a single parameter and returns a scrambled version of that string. The second method takes a list of strings and modifies the list by scrambling each entry in the list. Any entry that cannot be scrambled is removed from the list.

(a) Write the method `scrambleWord`, which takes a given word and returns a string that contains a scrambled version of the word according to the following rules.

*   The scrambling process begins at the first letter of the word and continues from left to right.
*   If two consecutive letters consist of an “A” followed by a letter that is not an “A”, then the two letters are swapped in the resulting string.
*   Once the letters in two adjacent positions have been swapped, neither of those two positions can be involved in a future swap.

The following table shows several examples of words and their scrambled versions.

Complete method `scrambleWord` below.

```java
/** Scrambles a given word.
  * @param word the word to be scrambled
  * @return the scrambled word (possibly equal to word)
  * Precondition: word is either an empty string or contains only uppercase letters.
  * Postcondition: the string returned was created from word as follows:
  * - the word was scrambled, beginning at the first letter and continuing from left to right
  * - two consecutive letters consisting of "A" followed by a letter that was not "A" were swapped
  * - letters were swapped at most once
  */
 public static String scrambleWord(String word)
```

(b) Write the method `scrambleOrRemove`, which replaces each word in the parameter `wordList` with its scrambled version and removes any words that are unchanged after scrambling. The relative ordering of the entries in `wordList` remains the same as before the call to `scrambleOrRemove`.

The following example shows how the contents of `wordList` would be modified as a result of calling `scrambleOrRemove`.

Before the call to `scrambleOrRemove`:

After the call to `scrambleOrRemove`:

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-40.png)

Assume that `scrambleWord` is in the same class as `scrambleOrRemove` and works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).

Complete method `scrambleOrRemove` below.

```java
/** Modifies wordList by replacing each word with its scrambled
 * version, removing any words that are unchanged as a result of scrambling.
 * @param wordList the list of words
 * Precondition: wordList contains only non-null objects
 * Postcondition:
 * - all words unchanged by scrambling have been removed from wordList
 * - each of the remaining words has been replaced by its scrambled version
 * - the relative ordering of the entries in wordList is the same as it was
 * before the method was called
 */
public static void scrambleOrRemove(List<String> wordList)
```

## Question 3

III. A student in a school is represented by the following class.

```java
public class Student
{
    /** Returns the name of this Student. */
    public String getName()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** Returns the number of times this Student has missed class. */
    public int getAbsenceCount()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

The class `SeatingChart`, shown below, uses a two-dimensional array to represent the seating arrangement of students in a classroom. The seats in the classroom are in a rectangular arrangement of rows and columns.

```java
public class SeatingChart
{
    /** seats[r][c] represents the Student in row r and column c in the classroom. */
    private Student[][] seats;

    /** Creates a seating chart with the given number of rows and columns from the students in
     * studentList. Empty seats in the seating chart are represented by null.
     * @param rows the number of rows of seats in the classroom
     * @param cols the number of columns of seats in the classroom
     * Precondition: rows > 0; cols > 0;
     * rows * cols >= studentList.size()
     * Postcondition:
     * - Students appear in the seating chart in the same order as they appear
     * in studentList, starting at seats[0][0].
     * - seats is filled column by column from studentList, followed by any
     * empty seats (represented by null).
     * - studentList is unchanged.
     */
    public SeatingChart(List<Student> studentList, int rows, int cols)
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    /** Removes students who have more than a given number of absences from the
     * seating chart, replacing those entries in the seating chart with null
     * and returns the number of students removed.
     * @param allowedAbsences an integer >= 0
     * @return number of students removed from seats
     * Postcondition:
     * - All students with allowedAbsences or fewer are in their original positions in seat
     * - No student in seats has more than allowedAbsences absences.
     * - Entries without students contain null.
     */
    public int removeAbsentStudents(int allowedAbsences)
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

(a) Write the constructor for the `SeatingChart` class. The constructor initializes the `seats` instance variable to a two-dimensional array with the given number of rows and columns. The students in `studentList` are copied into the seating chart in the order in which they appear in `studentList`. The students are assigned to consecutive locations in the array `seats`, starting at `seats[0][0]` and filling the array column by column. Empty seats in the seating chart are represented by `null`.

For example, suppose a variable `List<Student> roster` contains reference to `Student` objects in the following order.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-41.png)

A `SeatingChart` object created with the call `new SeatingChart(roster, 3, 4)` would have `seats` initialized with the following values.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-42.png)

Complete the `SeatingChart` constructor below.

```java
/** Creates a seating chart with the given number of rows and columns from the students in
 * studentList. Empty seats in the seating chart are represented by null.
 * @param rows the number of rows of seats in the classroom
 * @param cols the number of columns of seats in the classroom
 * Precondition: rows > 0; cols > 0;
 * rows * cols >= studentList.size()
 * Postcondition:
 * - Students appear in the seating chart in the same order as they appear
 * in studentList, starting at seats[0][0].
 * - seats is filled column by column from studentList, followed by any
 * empty seats (represented by null).
 * - studentList is unchanged.
 */
public SeatingChart(List<Student> studentList, int rows, int cols)
```

(b) Write the `removeAbsentStudents` method, which removes students who have more than a given number of absences from the seating chart and returns the number of students that were removed. When a student is removed from the seating chart, a `null` is placed in the entry for that student in the array `seats`. For example, suppose the variable `SeatingChart introCS` has been created such that the array `seats` contains the following entries showing both students and their number of absences.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-43.png)

After the call `introCS.removeAbsentStudents(4)` has executed, the array `seats` would contain the following values and the method would return the value 3.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-44.png)

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-45.png)

Complete method `removeAbsentStudents` below.

```java
/** Removes students who have more than a given number of absences from the
 * seating chart, replacing those entries in the seating chart with null
 * and returns the number of students removed.
 * @param allowedAbsences an integer >= 0
 * @return number of students removed from seats
 * Postcondition:
 * - All students with allowedAbsences or fewer are in their original positions in seat
 * - No student in seats has more than allowedAbsences absences.
 * - Entries without students contain null.
 */
public int removeAbsentStudents(int allowedAbsences)
```

## Question 4

IV. The menu at a lunch counter includes a variety of sandwiches, salads, and drinks. The menu also allows a customer to create a “trio,” which consists of three menu items: a sandwich, a salad, and a drink. The price of the trio is the sume of the two highest-priced menu items in the trio; one item with the lowest price is free.

Each menu item has a name and a price. The four types of menu items are represented by the four classes `Sandwich`, `Salad`, `Drink`, and `Trio`. All four classes implement the following `MenuItem` inerface.

```java
public interface MenuItem
{
    /** @return the name of the menu item */
    String getName();

    /** @return the price of the menu item */
    double getPrice(); 
}
```

The following diagram shows the relationship between the `MenuItem` interface and the `Sandwich`, `Salad`, `Drink`, and `Trio` classes.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-46.png)

For example, assume that the menu includes the following items. The objects listed under each heading are instances of the class indicated by the heading.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-47.png)

The menu allows customers to create `Trio` menu items, each of which includes a sandwich, a salad, and a drink. The name of the `Trio` consists of the names of the sandwich, salad, and drink, in that order, each separated by `"/"` and followed by a space and then `"trio"`. The price of the `"trio"` is the sum of the two highest-priced items in the `"Trio"`; one item with the lowest price is free.

A trio consisting of a cheeseburger, spinach salad, and an organe soda would have the name `"Cheeseburger/Spinach Salad/Orange Soda Trio"` and a price of $4.00 (the two highest prices are $2.75 and $1.25). Similarily, a trio consisting of a club sandwich, coleslaw, and a cappuccino would have the name `"Club Sandwich/Coleslaw/Cappuccino Trio"` and a price of $6.25 (the two highest prices are $2.75 and $3.50).

Write the `Trio` class that implements the `MenuItem` interface. Your implementation must include a constructor that takes three parameters representing a sandwich, salad, and drink. The following code segment should have the indicated behavior.

```java
Sandwich sandwich;
Salad salad;
Drink drink;
/* Code that initializes sandwich, salad, and drink */

Trio trio = new Trio(sandwich, salad, drink); // Compiles without error
Trio trio1 = new Trio(salad, sandwich, drink); // Compile-time error
Trio trio2 = new Trio(sandwich, salad, salad); // Compile-time error
```

Write the complete `Trio` class below.
