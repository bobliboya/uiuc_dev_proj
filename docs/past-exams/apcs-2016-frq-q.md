## Question1

I. This question involves the implementation and extension of a `RandomStringChooser` class.

(a) A `RandomStringChooser` object is constructed from an array of non-null `String` values. When the object is first constructed, all of the strings are considered available. The `RandomStringChooser` class has a `getNext` method, which has the following behavior. A call to `getNext` returns a randomly chosen string from the available strings in the object. Once a particular string has been returned from a call to `getNext`, it is no longer available to be returned from subsequent calls to `getNext`. If no strings are available to be returned, `getNext` returns `"NONE"`.

The following code segment shows an example of the behavior of `RandomStringChooser`.

```java
String[] wordArray = {"wheels", "on", "the", "bus"};
RandomStringChooser sChooser = new RandomStringChooser(wordArray);
for (int k = 0; k < 6; k++)
{
    System.out.print(sChooser.getNext() + " ");
}
```

One possible output is shown below. Because `sChooser` has only four strings, the string `"NONE"` is printed twice.

```java
bus the wheels on NONE NONE
```

Write the entire `RandomStringChooser` class. Your implementation must include an appropriate constructor and any necessary methods. Any instance variables must be `private`. The code segment in the example above should have the indicated behavior (that is, it must compile and produce a result like the possible output shown). Neither the constructor nor any of the methods should alter the parameter passed to the constructor, but your implementation may copy the contents of the array.

(b) The following partially completed `RandomLetterChooser` class is a subclass of the `RandomStringChooser` class. You will write the constructor for the `RandomLetterChooser` class.

```java
public class RandomLetterChooser extends RandomStringChooser
{
    /** Constructs a random letter chooser using the given string str.
     * Precondition: str contains only letters
     */
    public RandomLetterChooser(String str)
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    /** Returns an array of single-letter strings.
     * Each of these strings consists of a single letter from str. Element k
     * of the returned array contains the single letter at position k of str.
     * For example, getSingleLetters("cat") returns the
     * array { "c", "a", "t" }.
     */
    public static String[] getSingleLetters(String str)
    { /* implementation not shown */ }
}
```

The following code segment shows an example of using `RandomLetterChooser`.

```java
RandomLetterChooser letterChooser = new RandomLetterChooser("cat");
for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++)
{
    System.out.print(letterChooser.getNext());
}
```

The code segment will print the three letters in `"cat"` in one of the possible orders. Because there are only three letters in the original string, the code segment prints `"NONE"` the fourth time through the loop. One possible output is shown below.

```java
actNONE
```

Assume that the `RandomStringChooser` class that you wrote in part (a) has been implemented correctly and that `getSingleLetters` works as specified. You must use `getSingleLetters` appropriately to receive the full credit.

Complete the `RandomLetterChooser` constructor below.

```java
/** Consturcts a random letter chooser using the given string str.
 * Precondition: str contains only letters.
 */
public RandomLetterChooser(String str)
```

## Question 2

II. This question involves two classes that are used to process log messages. A list of sample log messages is given below.

```java
CLIENT3:security alert - repeated login failures
Webserver:disk offline
SERVER1:file not found
SERVER2:read error on disk DSK1
SERVER1:write error on disk DSK2
Webserver:error on /dev/disk
```

Log messages have the format _machineId:description_, where _machineId_ identifies the computer and _description_ describes the event being logged. Exactly one colon (“:”) appears in a log message. There are no blanks either immediately berfore or immediately after the colon.

The following `LogMessage` class is used to represent a log message.

```java
public class LogMessage
{
    private String machineId;
    private String description;

    /** Precondition: message is a valid log message. */
    public LogMessage(String message)
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    /** Returns true if the description in this log message properly contains keyword;
     * false otherwise
     */
    public boolean containsWord(String keyword)
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    public String getMachineId()
    { return machineId; }

    public String getDescription()
    { return description; }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

(a) Write the constructor for the `LogMessage` class. It must initialize the private data of the object so that `getMachineId` returns the _machineId_ part of the message and `getDescription` returns the _description_ part of the message.

Complete the `LogMessage` constructor below.

```java
/** Precondition: message is a valid log message. */
public LogMessage(String message)
```

(b) Write the `LogMessage` method `containsWord`, which returns `true` if the description in the log message _properly contains_ a given keyword and returns `false` otherwise.

A description _properly contains_ a keyword if all three of the following conditions are true.

*   the keyword is a substring of the description;
*   the keyword is either at the beginning of the description or it is immediately preceded by a space;
*   the keyword is either at the end of the description or it is immediately followed by a space.

The following tables show several examples. The descriptions in the left table properly contain the keyword `"disk"`. The descriptions in the right table do not properly contain the keyword `"disk"`.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-19.png)

Assume that the `LogMessage` constructor works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).

Complete method `containsWord` below.

```java
/** Returns true if the description in this log message properly contains keyword;
 * false otherwise.
 */
public boolean containsWord(String keyword)
```

(c) The `SystemLog` class represents a list of `LogMessage` objects and provides a method that removes and returns a list of all log messages (if any) that properly contain a given keyword. The messages in the returned list appear in the same order in which they originally appeared in the system log. If no message properly contains the keyword, an empty list is returned. The declaration of the `SystemLog` class is shown below.

```java
public class SystemLog
{
    /** Contains all the entries in this system log.
     * Guaranteed not to be null and to contain only non-null entries.
     */
    private List<LogMessage> messageList;

    /** Removes from the system log all entries whose descriptions properly contain keyword,
     * and returns a list (possibly empty) containing the removed entries.
     * Postcondition:
     * - Entries in the returned list properly contain keyword and
     * are in the order in which they appeared in the system log.
     * - The remaining entries in the system log do not properly contain keyword and
     * are in their original order.
     * - The returned list is empty if no messages properly contain keyword.
     */
    public List<LogMessage> removeMessages(String keyword)
    { /* to be implemented in part(c) */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

Write the `SystemLog` method `removeMessages`, which removes from the system log all entries whose descripotions properly contain `keyword` and returns a list of the removed entries in their original order. For example, assume that `theLog` is a `SystemLog` object initially containing six `LogMessage` objects representing the following list of log messages.

```java
CLIENT3:security alert - repeated login failures
Webserver:disk offline
SERVER1:file not found
SERVER2:read error on disk DSK1
SERVER1:write error on disk DSK2
Webserver:error on /dev/disk
```

The class `theLog.removeMessages("disk")` would return a list containing the `LogMessage` objects representing the following log messages.

```java
Webserver:disk offline
SERVER2:read error on disk DSK1
SERVER1:write error on disk DSK2
```

After the call, `theLog` would contain the following log messages.

```java
CLIENT3:security alert - repeated login failures
SERVER1:file not found
Webserver:error on /dev/disk
```

Assume that the `LogMessage` class works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in parts (a) and (b). You must use `containsWord` appropriately to receive full credit.

Complete method `removeMessages` below.

```java
/** Removes from the system log all entries whose descriptions properly contain keyword,
 * and returns a list (possibly empty) containing the removed entries.
 * Postcondition:
 * - Entries in the returned list properly contain keyword and
 * are in the order in which they appeared in the system log.
 * - The remaining entries in the system log do not properly contain keyword and
 * are in their original order.
 * - The returned list is empty if no messages properly contain keyword.
 */
public List<LogMessage> removeMessages(String keyword)
```

## Question 3

III. A crossword puzzle grid is a two-dimensional rectangular array of black and white squares. Some of the white squares are labeled with a positive number according to the _crossword labeling rule_.

The crossword labeling rule identifies squares to be labeled with a positive number as follows.

A square is labeled with a postive number if and only if

*   the square is white and
*   the square does not have a white square immediately above it, or it does not have a white square immediately to its left, or both.

The squares identified by these criteria are labeled with consecutive numbers in row-major order, starting at 1.

The following diagram shows a crossword puzzle grid and the labeling of the squares according to the crossword labeling rule.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-20.png)

This question uses two classes, a `Square` class that represents an individual square in the puzzle and a `Crossword` clas that represents a crossword puzzle grid. A partial declaration of the `Square` clas is shown below.

```java
public class Square
{
    /** Constructs one square of a crossword puzzle grid.
     * Postcondition:
     * - The square is black if and only if isBlack is true.
     * - The square has number num.
     */
    public Square(boolean isBlack, int num)
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

A partial declaration of the `Crossword` class is shown below. You will implement one method and the constructor in the `Crossword` class.

```java
public class Crossword
{
    /** Each element is a Square object with a color (black or white) and a number.
     * puzzle[r][c] represents the square in row r, column c.
     * There is at least one row in the puzzle.
     */
    private Square[][] puzzle;

    /** Constructs a crossword puzzle grid.
     * Precondition: There is at least one row in blackSquares.
     * Postcondition:
     * - The crossword puzzle grid has the same dimensions as blackSquares.
     * - The Square object at row r, column c in the crossword puzzle grid is black
     * if and only if blackSquares[r][c] is true.
     * - The squares in the puzzle are labeled according to the crossword labeling rule.
     */
    public Crossword(boolean[][] blackSquares)
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    /** Returns true if the square at row r, column c should be labeled with a positive number;
     * false otherwise.
     * The square at row r, column c is black if and only if blackSquares[r][c] is true.
     * Precondition: r and c are valid indexes in blackSquares.
     */
    private boolean toBeLabeled(int r, int c, boolean[][] blackSquares)
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

(a) Write the `Crossword` method `toBeLabeled`. The method returns `true` if the square indexed by row `r`, column `c` in a crossword puzzle grid should be labeled with a postive number according to the crossword labeling rule; otherwise it returns `false`. the parameter `blackSquares` indicates which squares in the crossword puzzle grid are black.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-21.png)

Complete the method `toBeLabeled` below.

```java
/** Returns true if the square at row r, column c should be labeled with a positive number;
 * false otherwise.
 * The square at row r, column c is black if and only if blackSquares[r][c] is true.
 * Precondition: r and c are valid indexes in blackSquares.
 */
private boolean toBeLabeled(int r, int c, boolean[][] blackSquares)
```

(b) Write the `Crossword` constructor. The constructor should initialize the crossword puzzle grid to have the same dimensions as the parameter `blackSquares`. Each element of the puzzle grid should be initialized with a reference to a `Square` object with the appropriate color and number. The number is positive if the square is labeled and 0 if the square is not labeled.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-21.png)

Assume that `toBeLabeled` works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a). You must use `toBeLabeled` appropriately to receive full credit.

Complete the `Crossword` constructor below.

```java
/** Constructs a crossword puzzle grid.
 * Precondition: There is at least one row in blackSquares.
 * Postcondition:
 * - The crossword puzzle grid has the same dimensions as blackSquares.
 * - The Square object at row r, column c in the crossword puzzle grid is black
 * if and only if blackSquares[r][c] is true.
 * - The squares in the puzzle are labeled according to the crossword labeling rule.
 */
public Crossword(boolean[][] blackSquares)
```

## Question 4

IV. This question involves the process of taking a list of words, called `wordList`, and producing a formatted string of a specified length. The list `wordList` contains at least two words, consisting of letters only.

When the formatted string is constructed, spaces are placed in the gaps between words so that as many spaces as possible are evenly distributed to each gap. The equal number of spaces inserted into each gap is referred to as the _basic gap width_. Any _leftover spaces_ are inserted one at a time into the gaps from left to right until there are no more leftover spaces.

The following three examples illustrate these concepts. In each example, the list of words is to be placed into a formatted string of length 20.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-22.png)

You will implement three `static` methods in a class named `StringFormatter` that is not shown.

(a) Write the `StringFormatter` method `totalLetters`, which returns the total number of letters in the words in its parameter `wordList`. For example, if the variable `List<String> words` is `["A", "frog", "is"]`, then the call `StringFormatter.totalLetters(words)` returns `7`. You may assume that all words in `wordList` consist of one or more letters.

Complete method `totalLetters` below.

```java
/** Returns the total number of letters in wordList.
 * Precondition: wordList contains at least two words, consisting of letters only.
 */
public static int totalLetters(List<String> wordList)
```

(b) Write the `StringFormatter` method `basicGapWidth`, which returns the basic gap width as defined earlier.

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-23.png)

Assume that `totalLetters` works as specified regardless of what you wrote in part (a). You must use `totalLetters` appropriately to receive full credit.

Complete method `basicGapWidth` below.

```java
/** Returns the basic gap width when wordList is used to produce
 * a formatted string of formattedLen characters.
 * Precondition: wordList contains at least two words, consisting of letters only.
 * formattedLen is large enough for all the words and gaps.
 */
public static int basicGapWidth(List<String> wordList, int formattedLen)
```

(c) Write the `StringFormatter` method `format`, which returns the formatted string as defined earlier. The `StringFormatter` class also contains a method called `leftoverSpaces`, which has already been implemented. This method returns the number of leftover spaces as defined earlier and is shown below.

```java
/** Returns the number of leftover spaces when wordList is used to produce
 * a formatted string of formattedLen characters.
 * Precondition: wordList contains at least two words, consisting of letters only.
 * formattedLen is large enough for all the words and gaps.
 */
public static int leftoverSpaces(List<String> wordList, int formattedLen)
{ /* implementation not shown */ }
```

![](http://apcompsci.cn/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/image-23.png)

Assume that `basicGapWidth` works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (b). You must use `basicGapWidth` and `leftoverSpaces` appropriately to receive full credit.

Complete method `format` below.

```java
/** Returns a formatted string consisting of the words in wordList separated by spaces.
 * Precondition: The wordList contains at least two words, consisting of letters only.
 * formattedLen is large enough for all the words and gaps.
 * Postcondition: All words in wordList appear in the formatted string.
 * - The words appear in the same order as in wordList.
 * - The number of spaces between words is determined by basicGapWidth and the
 * distribution of leftoverSpaces from left to right, as described in the question.
 */
public static String format(List<String> wordList, int formattedLen)
```
